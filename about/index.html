	<h1>A few words about Dipanjan.</h1>
	<p>I am a student of Chemical Engineering, currently in the third year of my four-year Bachelor of Engineering Degree at <a href="http://www.jaduniv.edu.in">Jadavpur University</a>, Kolkata, India. I have a keen interest in the basic sciences and believe in the philosophy of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neal_Amundson">Neal R. Amundson </a>, a man who "played a pivotal role in transforming the field of chemical engineering from <em>glorified plumbing</em> and phenomenological <em>chemical recipes</em> to a rigorous discipline that translated scientific phenomena into engineering practice through sophisticated mathematical modeling."</p>
	<p>Beyond the realms of traditional chemical engineering, I have had the opportunity to venture into the world of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_probability">Bayesian Probability</a>, which interprets <em>probability</em> as a <em>state of belief</em>, in contrast to the frequentists' view of probability as the relative frequency of the occurence of an event observed in an experiment which is unrealistically repeated an infinite number of times. Bayesian probability may be viewed as an extension of logic, or in the words of Sherlock Holmes, <i>"When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however unlikely, must be the truth."</i></p>
