	<h1>A few words about Dipanjan.</h1>
	<p>I completed my undergraduate degree in Chemical Engineering from <a href="http://www.jaduniv.edu.in">Jadavpur University</a>, Kolkata, India. I have always been keenly interested in fundamental sciences, and during my undergraduate, I learnt about and believed in the philosophy of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neal_Amundson">Prof. Neal R. Amundson</a>, a man who "played a pivotal role in transforming the field of chemical engineering from <em>glorified plumbing</em> and phenomenological <em>chemical recipes</em> to a rigorous discipline that translated scientific phenomena into engineering practice through sophisticated mathematical modeling." Currently, I work in a building named after Prof. Amundson, at the <a href="https://cse.umn.edu/cems">Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science</a> at the <a href="https://twin-cities.umn.edu/">University of Minnesota</a>.</p>

	<p>I am a Ph.D. candidate working with <a href="https://cheng.cems.umn.edu/">Prof. Xiang Cheng</a>, where I use optical microscopy techniques to study the collective and individual motion of the swimming bacterium <i>Escherichia coli</i>. The goal of my research is to understand how the indivdual swimming behavior of bacteria, as well as the interactions between them enable them to organize into structures much larger than the scale of an individual bacterium. This understanding will help us gain insights into the rules of organization of active matter, and help design the materials of tomorrow. When I was an undergraduate student taking the courses of thermodynamics and transport phenomena, I was always fascinated by the question: how can we translate this knowledge to the case of systems that are living and out of equilibrium? Is there any "equation of state" or "constitutive equation" for a complicated system like a crowd of people leaving the stadium after a game of soccer? The aim of my research is to take us a step forward in answering these questions.</p>

	<p>Beyond the realms of traditional chemical engineering, I have had the opportunity to venture into the world of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_probability">Bayesian Probability</a>, which interprets <em>probability</em> as a <em>state of belief</em>, in contrast to the frequentists' view of probability as the relative frequency of the occurence of an event observed in an experiment which is unrealistically repeated an infinite number of times. Bayesian probability may be viewed as an extension of logic, or in the words of Sherlock Holmes, <i>"When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however unlikely, must be the truth."</i></p>
