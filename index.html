	<h1>Hi there, Welcome to Dipanjan's Homepage!</h1>
	<p>I'm Dipanjan Ghosh, currently a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science at the University of Minnesota. My research aims to understand the physics of "active matter", which are objects that can move on their own. Examples of active matter includes you and me, as well as birds flying in the sky, fish swimming in the oceans, all the way down to bacteria at the microscale and molecular motor proteins at the nanoscale. I am trying to understand the principles that lead all these fascinating systems to self-organize into structures larger than their individual scales, such as mesmirizing murmurations of starlings, or the annoying cloud of gnats disrupting a hike in the woods. When I am not doing experiments in the lab looking at swimming bacteria, I am usually doing experiments in the kitchen trying to cook dishes from all over the world, or looking at the marvelous scenic beauty of the natural landscape of Minnesota.</p>
