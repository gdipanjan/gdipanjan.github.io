# An Introduction to this Blog

> ### word of the day:
> **euneirophrenia**
> A peaceful state of mind following a pleasant dream 


I am starting this blog mostly out of necessity. The necessity of sharing my experiences with you, and documenting them so that I may revisit them in later stages of life. 

I am not sure if *travelling* qualifies as a hobby for me, as I have only seen three Indian cities in the first twenty one years of my life. But it is those three months that I spent in Chennai last year, that transformed my life in an unimaginable way. I often regret not having a memoir for that trip, and can only rely on figments of my memory for reminiscence, followed by an insatiable longing to travel back in time and relive those days. Here I am now, packing my bags for Boston, MA, knocking on the door of what people call a life changing experience. There could not have been a better time for starting a blog. 

This is what this blog will *probably* feature, in decreasing order of frequency, my thoughts, experiences, travel, culinary adventures, the sporadic review and my struggles in soft condensed matter physics.
