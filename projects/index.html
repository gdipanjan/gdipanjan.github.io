	<h1>My research projects in a nutshell</h1>
	<p>Here is a brief introduction to the research projects which I have worked on:</p>

	<p><b><i>Collective swimming of Escherichia coli under geometric confinement :</i></b> What makes our experience of driving on the highway very different compared to a bumper car ride? While driving on the highway, we try to avoid crashing into other cars. However, what makes a bumper car ride fun are the collisions with other cars. Now, in our experiments with swimming <i>Escherichia coli</i> bacteria, we were able to toggle their ability to "crash" into each other. This was done by constructing microfluidic devices of different thicknesses, where a pair of bacteria can crash or not crash into each other if the thickness is small or large respectively. We found that in the case where bacteria avoided crashes, they arranged themselves into long-range lanes travelling in mutually anti-parallel directions, similar to a two-lane highway. However, when the bacteria crashed into each otehr, we observed dynamic short-range clusters, reminiscent of those formed by colliding bumper cars. This work demonstrates that geometric confinement can be used as an effective tool for controlling the interaction rules between active particles, in this case the swimming bacteria, which can dramatically affect their emergent behavior at larger length scales.</p>

	<p><b><i>Swimming speeds of Escherichia coli cells of different sizes:</i></b> In the world familiar to us, taller athletes swim faster. However, we have shown that this intuition breaks down in the microscopic world of swimming Escherichia coli. We have experimentally found the counterintuitive result: bacterial cells of different sizes swim at the same speed! This result is surpising even from the perspective of low-Reynolds number hydrodynamics, which predicts that a larger cell will experience a larger drag force and will swim slower. By fluorescent imaging of the bacterial flagella, the propeller that powers their swimming, we are constructing a data-driven model that takes into account the geometric details of the flagella, which can explain our counterintuitive findings. </p>

	<p><b><i>Phase behavior of mutually polarizable colloidal particles:</i></b> Supervised by <a href ="http://web.mit.edu/swangroup/">Prof. James W. Swan</a> at <a href="https://cheme.mit.edu/">the Department of Chemical Engineering, Massachsetts Institute of Technology</a>. This project aimed at understanding the thermodynamic behavior of dielectric/paramagnetic colloidal suspensions under an applied electric/magnetic field using Brownian Dynamics simulations. This work considered the exact nature of pairwise interactions between mutually polarizable particles, which is ignored in simplistic mean-field theoretical models. We mapped a phase diagram finding coexistence between three different structural phases, which had not been previously predicted using the simplistic models. These findings will aid in the design of electro-rheological and magneto-rheological fluids, whose properties can be tuned using externally applied fields.</p>

	<p><b><i>Bayesian inference of optical trap stiffness and particle diffusion :</i></b> Supervised by <a href ="https://ronojoy.github.io">Ronojoy Adhikari</a> at <a href="https://www.imsc.res.in">The Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai</a>. The objective of this work was to formulate an exact Bayesian method for jointly estimating the mean regression rate and the diffusion coefficient of a Brownian particle in an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_tweezers">optical trap</a>. Knowledge of the particle diffusion coefficient is of immense utility, as it can be used to determine the viscosity of fluid samples in the <em>nanoliter</em> range, for which conventional viscometric methods cannot be used. Experimental data was provided by <a href="http://www.iiserkol.ac.in/~ayan/">Ayan Banerjee</a> of IISER, Kolkata. The overdamped Brownian motion was modelled by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornstein–Uhlenbeck_process">Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process</a> and simple analytical expressions for the maximum a posteriori estimates were derived using exact likelihoods. The advantages of the Bayesian method over traditional non-Bayesian fitting methods were discussed. The Bayesian methods used for this work are documented in this open-source <a href ="https://github.com/ronojoy/pybisp">software package</a>.</p>
