	<h1>My research projects in a nutshell</h1>
	<p>Here is a brief introduction to the research projects which I have been a part of.</p>
	<p><b><i>Bayesian inference of optical trap stiffness and particle diffusion :</i></b> Supervised by <a href ="https://ronojoy.github.io">Ronojoy Adhikari</a> at <a href="https://www.imsc.res.in">The Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai.</a>The objective of this work to formulate an exact Bayesian method for jointly estimating the mean regression rate and the diffusion coefficient of a Brownian particle in an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_tweezers">optical trap</a>. Knowledge of the particle diffusion coefficient is of immense utility, as it can be used to determine the viscosity of fluid samples in the <em>nanoliter</em> range, for which conventional viscometric methods cannot be used. Experimental data was provided by <a href="http://www.iiserkol.ac.in/~ayan/">Ayan Banerjee</a> of IISER, Kolkata. The overdamped Brownian motion was modelled by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornstein–Uhlenbeck_process">Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process</a> and simple analytical expressions for the maximum a posteriori estimates were derived using exact likelihoods. The advantages of the Bayesian method over traditional non-Bayesian fitting methods were discussed. The Bayesian methods used for this work are documented in this open-source <a href ="https://github.com/ronojoy/pybisp">software package</a>.</p>
